Documentation
===============
This is a website dedicated to logging the random processes or 
projects I go through to get something working properly. A lot 
of things will be thrown about places, apologies if the 
organization is a bit dodgy at times. Most stuff here will involve 
either the development of 'things', or how to get certain things 
working in areas that have poor documentation.

What I do
----------
I primarily work on things that benefit me or some friends. The 
only projects I've made that I consider 'major' are related 
to speedrunning, or are small-scale desktop applications that 
benefit my personal workflow. I've developed on all of the 
major operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), but currently
mainly operate macOS. Sue me. 

Important
----------
Nothing here is fact checked. Like, absolutely nothing. Most of 
the things that will be written here are loose notes for myself 
and how I got certain things to work. If something I write does 
not work for you, please don't contact me asking for me to fix 
my documentation. Unless you want to give another solution that 
worked for you, in which case I may add a note.

Point is, this is very loose. Sorry.
